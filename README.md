# This fork has enforced chronos async paradigm

# amysql  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bung87/amysql.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bung87/amysql)  

`amysql` implements (a subset of) the MySQL/MariaDB client protocol based on asyncnet and asyncdispatch.  

`amysql` implements both the **text protocol** (send a simple string query, get back results as strings) and the **binary protocol** (get a prepared statement handle from a string with placeholders; send a set of value bindings, get back results as various datatypes approximating what the server is using).  

`amysql` implements async connection pool(`amysql/async_pool`) and a threaded pool(`amysql/db_pool`).  

## Usage  

### Compile flags  

```
async macro:
ChronosAsync 

chronos use its own async macro will conflicts with std async macro , use this flag if your project use chronos.  

socket io:
const ReadTimeOut {.intdefine.} = 30_000
const WriteTimeOut {.intdefine.} = 60_000  

idle check:
const TestWhileIdle* {.booldefine.} = true
const MinEvictableIdleTime {.intdefine.} = 60_0000
const TimeBetweenEvictionRuns {.intdefine.} = 30_000  

compression:  
const mysql_compression_mode {.booldefine.} = false
const ZstdCompressionLevel {.intdefine.} = 3

pool:
const ResetConnection* {.booldefine.} = true # reset session when reuse 

```
## Goals

The goals of this project are:

1. **Similar API to Nim's std db lib** 
2. **Async:** All operations must be truly asynchronous whenever possible.
3. **High performance:** Avoid unnecessary allocations and copies when reading data.
4. **Managed:** Managed code only, no native code.
6. **Independent:** This is a clean-room reimplementation of the [MySQL Protocol](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/client-server-protocol.html), not based on C lib.  

## Testing  

platform: Linux and OSX  

mysql: 5.7 8.0  

mariadb: 10  

## TODO  

- [ ] Finish caching_sha2_password_auth.  
- [ ] Testing ssl mode ,unix socket mode.  
- [x] mutiple statements and mutilple resultsets.
- [x] compression mode (zstd)  
- [x] handle connection options

## History  

When I starting this project, I have `wiml/nim-asyncmysql` and `asyncmysql` for inspiration, the initial goal is provide basic asynchronous apis compare to Nim std library `db_mysql`'s synchronous apis, `asyncmysql` provide mutiple results feature and callback style apis by design, he map mysql protocol flags to exact to c types, `wiml/nim-asyncmysql` provide asynchronous apis and map flags to enum type and the project design is very obvious to me, so I choose base on `wiml/nim-asyncmysql`.  

When this project ready to use, it provide single statement and single results, I starting considering provide compression api, at that time data recevie as string and passing around procs, I starting store data to `seq[char]` as I dont want decompress data and passing around procs, and it also help me move next step, implements multiple results feature. Compare to `asyncmysql` ,`asyncmysql` use a constant size array buffer to store data, I may change as it so in the future.

Above declaration may not explain "Why this project exists ?", here's some key points.  

When I starting this project `asyncmysql` and `wiml/nim-asyncmysql` have no commits activities for years. `wiml/nim-asyncmysql` even can't compile for current Nim version.  

1. `db_mysql` provide synchronous apis and need external c library.
2. `asyncmysql` provide callback style apis.
3. `wiml/nim-asyncmysql` satisify the design, but need update to current Nim version, more column data type mapping, more features , more client capbilities.
